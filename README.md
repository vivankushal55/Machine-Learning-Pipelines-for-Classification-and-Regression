# 🚦 CSC8635 Machine Learning Mini-Projects
**Accident Severity Classification & Regression Analysis**

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains coursework for **CSC8635 – Machine Learning**, focusing on the design, implementation, and evaluation of end-to-end machine learning pipelines. The project consists of two mini-projects covering both **classification** and **regression** tasks using tabular datasets.

All experiments are implemented in **Python** and designed to be executed in **Google Colab Pro**.

## 🧪 Mini-Project 1: Accident Severity Classification
- **Dataset:** FARS (Fatality Analysis Reporting System)
- **Task:** Multi-class classification  
- **Target Variable:** `INJURY_SEVERITY`

**Objective:**  
To classify road accident severity using multiple machine learning pipelines and compare their performance through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

---

## 📈 Mini-Project 2: Regression Analysis (Fitting Dataset)
- **Dataset:** Fitting dataset  
- **Task:** Supervised regression  
- **Target Variable:** Continuous numerical value  

**Objective:**  
To model the relationship between input features and a continuous target variable, comparing different regression pipelines and analysing generalisation performance.
